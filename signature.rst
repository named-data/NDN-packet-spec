.. _Signature:

Signature
---------

NDN Signature is defined as two consecutive TLV blocks: ``SignatureInfo`` and ``SignatureValue``.
The following general considerations about SignatureInfo and SignatureValue blocks that apply for all signature types:

1. ``SignatureInfo`` is **included** in signature calculation and fully describes the signature, signature algorithm, and any other relevant information to obtain parent certificate(s), such as :ref:`KeyLocator`

2. ``SignatureValue`` is **excluded** from signature calculation and represent actual bits of the signature and any other supporting signature material.

The reason for separating the signature into two separate TLV blocks is to allow efficient signing of a contiguous memory block (e.g., for Data packet this block starts from Name TLV and ends with SignatureInfo TLV).

.. _KeyLocator:

KeyLocator
~~~~~~~~~~

A ``KeyLocator`` specifies either ``Name`` that points to another Data packet containing certificate or public key or ``KeyDigest`` to identify the public key within a specific trust model (the trust model definition is outside the scope of the current specification).
Note that although ``KeyLocator`` is defined as an optional field in ``SignatureInfo`` block, some signature types may require presence of it and some require ``KeyLocator`` absence.

::

    KeyLocator ::= KEY-LOCATOR-TYPE TLV-LENGTH (Name | KeyDigest)

    KeyDigest ::= KEY-DIGEST-TYPE TLV-LENGTH BYTE+

See :ref:`Name specification <Name>` for the definition of Name field.

The specific definition of the usage of ``Name`` and ``KeyDigest`` options in ``KeyLocator`` field is outside the scope of this specification.
Generally, ``Name`` names the Data packet with the corresponding certificate.
However, it is up to the specific trust model to define whether this name is a full name of the Data packet or a prefix that can match multiple Data packets.
For example, the hierarchical trust model :cite:`testbed-key-management` uses the latter approach, requiring clients to fetch the latest version of the Data packet pointed by the KeyLocator (the latest version of the public key certificate) in order to ensure that the public key was not yet revoked.

.. _DigestSha256:

DigestSha256
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``DigestSha256`` provides no provenance of a Data packet or any kind of guarantee that packet is from the original source.
This signature type is intended only for debug purposes and limited circumstances when it is necessary to protect only against unexpected modification during the transmission.

``DigestSha256`` is defined as a SHA256 hash of the :ref:`Name`, :ref:`MetaInfo`, :ref:`Content`, and :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` TLVs:

::

    SignatureInfo ::= SIGNATURE-INFO-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=3)
                        SIGNATURE-TYPE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=1) 0

    SignatureValue ::= SIGNATURE-VALUE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=32)
                         BYTE+(=SHA256{Name, MetaInfo, Content, SignatureInfo})

Note that ``SignatureInfo`` does not require ``KeyLocator`` field, since there digest calculation and verification does not require any additional information.
If ``KeyLocator`` is present in ``SignatureInfo``, it must be ignored.

.. _SignatureSha256WithRsa:

SignatureSha256WithRsa
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``SignatureSha256WithRsa`` is the basic signature algorithm that MUST be supported by any NDN-compliant software.
As suggested by the name, it defines an RSA public key signature that is calculated over SHA256 hash of the :ref:`Name`, :ref:`MetaInfo`, :ref:`Content`, and :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` TLVs.


::

    SignatureInfo ::= SIGNATURE-INFO-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                        SIGNATURE-TYPE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=1) 1
                        KeyLocator

    SignatureValue ::= SIGNATURE-VALUE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                         BYTE+(=RSA over SHA256{Name, MetaInfo, Content, SignatureInfo})

.. note::

   SignatureValue size varies (typically 128 or 256 bytes) depending on the private key length used during the signing process.

This type of signature ensures strict provenance of a Data packet, provided that the signature verifies and signature issuer is authorized to sign the Data packet.
The signature issuer is identified using :ref:`KeyLocator` block in :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` block of ``SignatureSha256WithRsa``.
KeyDigest option in ``KeyLocator`` is defined as SHA256 digest over the DER encoding of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo for an RSA key as defined by `RFC 3279 <http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3279.txt>`_."
See :ref:`KeyLocator section <KeyLocator>` for more detail.

.. note::

    It is application's responsibility to define rules (trust model) of when a specific issuer (KeyLocator) is authorized to sign a specific Data packet.
    While trust model is outside the scope of the current specification, generally, trust model needs to specify authorization rules between KeyName and Data packet Name, as well as clearly define trust anchor(s).
    For example, an application can elect to use hierarchical trust model :cite:`testbed-key-management` to ensure Data integrity and provenance.

.. _SignatureSha256WithEcdsa:

SignatureSha256WithEcdsa
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``SignatureSha256WithEcdsa`` defines an ECDSA public key signature that is calculated over the SHA256 hash of the :ref:`Name`, :ref:`MetaInfo`, :ref:`Content`, and :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` TLVs.
The signature algorithm is defined in `[RFC5753], Section 2.1 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5753#section-2.1>`_.

::

    SignatureInfo ::= SIGNATURE-INFO-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                        SIGNATURE-TYPE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=1) 3
                        KeyLocator

    SignatureValue ::= SIGNATURE-VALUE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                         BYTE+(=ECDSA over SHA256{Name, MetaInfo, Content, SignatureInfo})

.. note::

   The SignatureValue size depends on the private key length used during the signing process (about 63 bytes for a 224 bit key).

This type of signature ensures strict provenance of a Data packet, provided that the signature verifies and the signature issuer is authorized to sign the Data packet.
The signature issuer is identified using the :ref:`KeyLocator` block in the :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` block of the ``SignatureSha256WithEcdsa``.
KeyDigest option in ``KeyLocator`` is defined as SHA256 digest over the DER encoding of the SubjectPublicKeyInfo for an EC key as defined by `RFC 5480 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt>`_.
See the :ref:`KeyLocator section <KeyLocator>` for more detail.

The value of ``SignatureValue`` of ``SignatureSha256WithEcdsa`` is a DER encoded DSA signature as defined in `Section 2.2.3 in RFC 3279 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279#section-2.2.3>`_.

::

    Ecdsa-Sig-Value  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
         r     INTEGER,
         s     INTEGER  }

.. _SignatureHmacWithSha256:

SignatureHmacWithSha256
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``SignatureHmacWithSha256`` defines a hash-based message authentication code that is calculated over
the  :ref:`Name`, :ref:`MetaInfo`, :ref:`Content`, and :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` TLVs, using SHA256
as the hashing function.  The signature algorithm is defined in `Section 2 in RFC 2104
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104#section-2>`_.

::

    SignatureInfo ::= SIGNATURE-INFO-TYPE TLV-LENGTH
                        SIGNATURE-TYPE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=1) 4
                        KeyLocator

    SignatureValue ::= SIGNATURE-VALUE-TYPE TLV-LENGTH(=32)
                         BYTE++(=SHA256({KeyValue XOR opad, SHA256({KeyValue XOR ipad, Name, MetaInfo, Content, SignatureInfo})}))

where

::

    opad = 0x5c5c5c...5c5c5c (repeated 64 times)
    ipad = 0x363636...363636 (repeated 64 times)

``Key`` is a shared key known to the sender and receiver of the signed packet.
``KeyValue`` is derived from a shared ``Key`` as follows. If the byte length of
``Key`` is less than the SHA256 block length (64 bytes) then append zeros to the
end of the ``Key`` to create the 64-byte ``KeyValue``. If the byte length of
``Key`` is greater than 64 bytes then hash it with SHA256 to produce a 32-byte
value then append 32 zeros to the end to create the 64-byte ``KeyValue``. (The
HMAC functions in most cryptographic libraries are supplied the ``Key`` and will
internally derive the ``KeyValue`` in this way.)

.. note::

   ``Key`` is not included in the signature. It is the application’s 
   responsibility to ensure that the receiver already knows the shared ``Key``.
   It can be identified using a ``KeyDigest`` as the :ref:`KeyLocator` block in
   the :ref:`SignatureInfo <Signature>` block of ``SignatureHmacWithSha256`` as
   follows. If the byte length of ``Key`` is less than or equal to the SHA256
   block length (64 bytes) then the ``KeyDigest`` is SHA256(``Key``). But if the
   byte length of ``Key`` is greater than 64 bytes, the ``KeyValue`` is already
   SHA256(``Key``) with zeros appended, so in this case ``KeyDigest`` is
   SHA256(SHA256(``Key``)).

.. note::

   As stated in in `Section 3 of RFC 2104
   <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104#section-3>`_ , keys shorter than the
   SHA256 output byte length (32 bytes) are strongly discouraged.

Provided that the signature verifies, this type of signature ensures provenance
that the Data packet was signed by one of the parties which holds the shared
``Key``. The key is identified using a ``KeyDigest`` as described above. It is
the application's responsibility to establish the identities of the parties who
hold the shared ``Key``.
